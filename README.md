## How It's Made:
<br/>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

the calculator is an object, with all functions inside as properties or methods of the object.

## Optimizations
<br/>
I switched out .eval() for .function() based on recommendations over security of it, eval is depreciated and not used anymore.

I got user feedback on the calculator, adding in a sub-display that shows the calcluation chain based on what people said when they used it.

## Lessons Learned:
<br/>
I was happy with the look and feel of the calculator, making it look and sound good motivated me to put extra work into it.

Before using methods, I need to check them out in more detail first - just because it works doesn't mean it's the best solution.

The calculator performs badly at odd resolutions, and not at all on mobile, with future work I would go into the media queries with
more detail making it look better at a range of different shapes and sizes.
